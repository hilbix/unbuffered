Options -u, -l and -a added, option -n changed.
Now installs into /usr/local/bin

With option -u and -l you can add a date-time prefix to lines written
to STDERR.  Option -n can be given multiple to change the line
numbering.

Option -a appends the output to STDERR instead to a file.  The file is
created if it is missing.  To allow easy logfile rotation, from time
to time the file is closed and reopened (thus recreated if missing).
