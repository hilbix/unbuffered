Options -u, -l and -a added, option -n changed, option -c improved.
Now installs into /usr/local/bin

With option -u and -l you can add a date-time prefix to lines written
to STDERR.  Option -n can be given multiple to change the line
numbering.

Option -a appends the output to a file and not to STDERR.  The file is
created if it is missing.  To allow easy logfile rotation, from time
to time the file is closed and reopened (thus recreated if missing).

Option -c was unreliable in that it dumped incomplete lines.
This has been changed such, that most time a full line will be
written, such that you can use it to number lines etc.
