Bugfix release for option -c.  Option -b added

WARNING!  The old unbuffered -c now must be written unbuffered -bc!

Incomplete lines were not output in cat mode in contrast to the Usage printed.
This was due to a problem noted by me with incomplete lines and -u.
Now you must use "unbuffered -bcu" instead of "unbuffered -cu".

This is important.  If you rely on the old method, please update your scripts accordingly.
