Copy stdin to stdout and stderr, unbuffered
# The next line must be empty

Often `tee` fails, as this command does it buffered.

This here is a really easy program to do it unbuffered.
Use it like this:
<pre>producer | unbuffered 2>>file | consumer</pre>

Now you can do also something like:
<pre>producer | unbuffered -cp 'prefix ' | consumer</pre>

There are options like '-x' to do a hexdump.
Also you can give a 'line prefix' to prepend.
And there is timestamping.

All you need to do your debugging, quick and dirty.
